In webhook mode, both `channels.feishu.webhookPath` and
`channels.feishu.accounts.<id>.webhookPath` must be canonical HTTP request paths
beginning with `/`, such as `/feishu/events`. An optional query string is
supported and must match exactly. Full URLs, relative paths, URL fragments, dot
segments, and unencoded spaces or Unicode are rejected. If an existing
configuration contains a noncanonical path, run `openclaw doctor --fix` to
repair it before starting the gateway.

## Gateway webhook route

Webhook mode uses the Gateway HTTP listener (`gateway.port`, normally `18789`)
at `webhookPath`, normally `/feishu/events`. Configure the public Feishu callback
URL or reverse proxy to reach that Gateway port and path. The route verifies
Feishu signatures and does not require Gateway bearer authentication. Accounts
can share a path when their encrypt keys are distinct; ambiguous signatures on
the Gateway port are rejected instead of selecting an arbitrary account. Old
accounts that share a path and encrypt key remain distinguishable on their
separate explicit legacy listeners. Give those accounts distinct encrypt keys or
webhook paths before moving their callbacks to the shared Gateway port.

On update, the plugin's Doctor migration moves an explicitly configured
`webhookPort` and its effective `webhookHost` into
`legacyWebhook: { port, host }`. Doctor's normal config backup protects the
original settings. This temporary listener forwards to the same Gateway route,
including its signature verification; it does not run a second webhook handler.
Existing canonical `legacyWebhook` settings win. A host without an explicit port
does not enable a legacy listener.

Installations that used the implicit old port `3000` must point their reverse
proxy upstream or Feishu callback URL to the Gateway port. Startup and Doctor
print the destination. OpenClaw cannot update callback URLs stored in the Feishu
console. After verifying delivery through the Gateway, remove `legacyWebhook`
and close the old port. The forwarding option is planned for retirement after
a two-month migration window; there is no automatic date-based cutoff.

The exact Gateway probe paths (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/ready`, `/readyz`,
`/startup`, and `/startupz`, including query strings) cannot receive Feishu
callbacks on the Gateway port. Without an explicit legacy listener, webhook
startup refuses these paths and names the replacement. An existing explicit
legacy listener continues serving the old path. Change `webhookPath` to
`/feishu/events` (or another unreserved path), update the Feishu callback URL or
reverse-proxy path, verify delivery on the Gateway, and only then remove
`legacyWebhook`. Paths nested below a probe path are not reserved by this rule.

Paths under `/api/channels` require Gateway authentication and cannot receive
ordinary Feishu callbacks on the Gateway port. This also applies to encoded
forms of that prefix. Startup and Doctor give the same path-change instructions;
explicit legacy listeners keep those callbacks working until the path and
external callback or proxy are migrated.
